       "['Well, I tell you what, I’m doing, I’m following the rules, man. Number one, I’m keeping the rules. My governor says he doesn’t want us out. I haven’t been out. I wear my mask. I have a mask. I got secret service outside. I walk outside, I have it on. They get tested. And by the way, I’m beating them across the board. 160 million people have watched me so far on shows like yours. All the stuff about it hurting me is not hurting me. I’m winning at all those states. I’m ahead in all the national polls and the more he talks, the better off I am.Totally different, man. 2016 is totally different. What you had then is you had somebody who they didn’t know at all. They wanted to just change the system the way it was. He was the biggest change. He had no serious opposition that turned out to materialize and so it’s totally different. Right now we’re in a situation where it’s like that Carney show goes through town once and you find out there’s no P under any one of those three shelves that get pushed around. Next time it comes back. What do you do? Next time back you ain’t playing. You’ve got to figure it out and let me tell you something. My community figured out a while ago. But here’s the deal. What I have to do is I have to continue to talk about the things that matter and the things that matter are, for example, right now there’s a study out of Columbia University and a disease control center up there. They pointed out that if he had listened to me and others and acted just one week earlier to deal with his virus, there’d be 36,000 fewer people dead. Dead. Dead. And you are wondering, what’s he doing? Come on, man. Get a life. Get a life. This guy has been incredibly terrible and what we’ve had is, back in January, I said, I wrote an article back I think the 27th of January said this pandemics here. We should act. Every other country that was active around the time, it got the notice around at the time we did, they have considerably fewer deaths as a percent of the population. I’m the guy that said we ought to take hard records and find out exactly how many people in the black community are getting COVID and are dying from it and look, what’s happened. Now everybody’s going, “Oh, surprise, surprise.”Look, everybody knows this. We have to come back. We have to fight back. The crisis slays, lay bare the institutional racism that’s still prevalent in our society. Now I believe we have to address it by transforming our economy and this time, bringing everybody along. He started to undermine the pillars of the economy before. Look, the blinders Charlamagne in my view, been taken off. Now people recognize that those essential workers, a disproportionate amount of them are African Americans and they’re breaking their necks, risking their lives, losing their lives. They’re grocery store workers. They’re bus drivers. They’re delivery people. They’re the people who are on the line. They’re the healthcare workers who are in a position where they’re taking care of the nurses. I mean and they’re making basically the minimum wage. So this time when we come back, if we hadn’t only rebuild, move this along, we not only rebuild, we have to transform this economy. We can create millions of new jobs in transportation, energy structure. A job has a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about how you’re treated and that’s how we built the working class, the middle class. But this time we have to address the institutional racism. We’ve seen it more clearly now. In a black majority county, there’s six times more likely to die in a pandemic than a white county. They’re disproportionately uninsured in the African Americans; disproportionately make up the central jobs that they can’t do at home. They’re risking their lives every day. Enough’s enough and this Biden recovery I’m going to put together will bring everybody along. I’m going to build a better future not back to what we had, but a better back to something better than we had.I won overwhelming. I told you when I got to South Carolina, I won every single county. I won a larger share of the black vote than anybody has, including Barack. I increased the vote in Virginia overwhelmingly by 70%. Look, what people don’t know about me is I come from a state as the eighth largest black population in America; the eighth largest. I get 96% of that vote for the last 40 years. They’re the folks. As they say at my way, brung me to the dance. That’s how I got elected every single time and everybody’s shocked. I get overwhelming support from the black leadership, young and old. Every poll shows me way ahead and it’s not just, I hear this. “Oh yeah, old blacks are with Biden but young aren’t.” Look at the polling data. Polling data, let’s say it’s off by half. Come on, man. Give me a little break here. This is where I come from. I got involved. I came home from college and I had a job with a really fancy law firm out of law school and my city is the only city in America, occupied by the National Guard, the military for 10 months when Doctor King was shot. I had this fancy job, a kid coming from a lower middle income household. I quit and became a public defender and I stayed in that community. I was the only guy when I was in high school. I had a job, a country club kind of job at a swimming pool. I was the only white employee in East side because I wanted to work in the projects because I wanted to understand. That’s how I got involved in politics. That’s what this is all about for me. It’s about equality. It’s about dignity. It’s about treating people with respect. So when you take a look at my record, people talk about the crime bill. Crime bill didn’t increase mass incarceration, other things increased mass incarceration and the reason why, if you go back and look, and I know you talk about it, you go back and take a look. That’s why you had the vast majority of the black caucus at the time, supporting the crime bill. Almost every major city black mayor supported the crime bill because blacks were getting killed overwhelmingly as well. What happened when that crime bill? It had four or five really important things. Now the Violence Against Women Act, it said drug court don’t send anybody who has a drug problem to jail, send them to rehabilitation, to a drug court. It had in it, they had the assault weapons ban getting of assault weapons, getting rid of the number of rounds you could have in a gun. It also had it at a whole range of other things, but it had things I didn’t like. Clinton wanted to put in a deal where in fact three strikes and you’re out. I opposed that three strikes and you’re out bill. I oppose the position taken that, saying that you’re going to have any mandatory sentences but on balance the whole bill, what happened was it did in fact, bring down violent crime in black communities as well. And guess what? The fact, is prison population didn’t increase. 94% of every prisoner in jail is in a state prison, not a federal prison. No federal law. And here’s the deal. The one thing I opposed in that bill was people wanting to give money to state prisons to build more prisons. I opposed it. But the point was on balance. Everything from the assault weapons ban to the violence against women, to the drug courts, they were important. Now look what we can do. Look, I’ve been pushing along with my colleagues in a black caucus in the United States Congress, we should change the entire and have been doing this for awhile. Change the entire prison system for one, that is punishment to rehabilitation. There’s only a couple of things everybody has in common in jail. One is they were the victims of abuse or their kids were, or their mother was. Number two, can’t read. Number three, they don’t have any job skills. They were in a position where they didn’t get a chance. Why does it make sense? Why did I come along and write the first act that said, when you get out of prison, you don’t just get a DOSA where you get 25 bucks and a bus ticket. You end up under the bridge, you end up under the bridge,and just do the same place. So every single solitary person being released from prison should have access to every single government program. Why does it not make sense to have African Americans who were getting out of prison, served their time, everybody for that matter, be able to have public housing? Why didn’t it make sense that they can have Pell grants to go to school? Why did it make sense they can have access to healthcare? What are we nuts? That’s what we keep doing.No, no. What happened was you’re what you’re confusing is what happened was the black caucus came to me and said, look, I did this study when I was chairman of the judiciary committee. We looked at every district of the 10 court districts in America, federal court districts and we found out that if you got arrested for robbery and convicted and I got a record of robbery and convicted and was the first time, you went to jail on average of 13 years. I went to jail an average of three years. So there was this whole move, same time for the same crime. So no one based on their color could go to jail longer than anybody else for the same crime. So what happened was there was a judicial selection committee setting up that how you deal with making sure that the sentencing process is taken out of the hands of a prosecutor saying I’m going to want 12 years, 13 years for you and three years for me. The end result of that was the unintended consequence, which we changed, Barack and I did, was the fact that you, in fact all of a sudden, you could not lower my sentence or your sentence be lower than what was the average sentence for everybody else going to jail in the districts. That’s how that came about. It didn’t say mandatory. We said to the judges, you can’t send people to jail for the same crime, different times. They have to be within a framework. That’s why that has been changed and while I was vice president, I helped Barack. We reduced the prison population, federally by like 38,000 people. 38,000 people. The only mandatory was in there was carjacking, which I opposed and three strikes and you’re out, which is ridiculous. It only was imposed three times but still even once makes no sense. The idea of three times three strikes and you’re out, give me a break. The other thing we have to do, one of the things and I was a public defender. I’m going to insist when I’m president that a public defender gets a federal public funding is paid the same amount of money as a federal prosecutor gets paid. So you have representation. People have representation. But the bottom line is, the other piece is, I’m going to try to change and I’ve laid it out. I’ll send you a copy of my plan. So you have it to see it.No, the plan I have is my manifesto for black America and to span, particularly the portion of it that relates to how in fact we’re going to deal with the prison system. If you are in prison, if you are convicted of a crime, no one should be going to jail for drug crime. Nobody. Particularly marijuana which makes no sense for people to go to jail. They should be just wiped out completely and the reason is, if anything for those crimes that are actually continue to be crime, scheduled crimes as marijuana shouldn’t be anymore, what is happening is you shouldn’t go to prison. You should go to a mandatory rehabilitation. It costs less to put people in a drug rehabilitation program than it does in jail and you have a chance. We’ve got to give people a chance.']"
